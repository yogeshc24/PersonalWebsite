  <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>What is a yurt? </dt>
      <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each 
          yurt is fully encolosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome
          that can be opened.
      </dd>
    <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
      <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired 
        stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricty and a sink with hot
        and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the 
        lodge.
      </dd>
    <dt>What should I bring? </dt>
      <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing 
        weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a 
        flashlight and a sense of adventure.
