      <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is a yurt? </dt>
        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each
          yurt is fully encolosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome
          that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired
          stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricty and a sink with hot
          and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the
          lodge.
        </dd>
        <dt>What should I bring? </dt>
        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
          weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a
          flashlight and a sense of adventure.
