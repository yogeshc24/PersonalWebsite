    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="homepgpic"><img src="images/nepalimage.jpg" alt="image of a temple in Nepal"></div>
    <p>My name is Yogesh Chaudhary and I was born in Nepal and moved to Davis in 2010.
      I speak 4 languages, which include English, Nepali, Hindi and Bhojpuri. A fun
      fact about me is that I have over 100 family members, but I only know 20 of them.
      In my free time I like to play games and hang out with friends. My friends and I
      go to different colleges, so it has been hard to meet up with them. I also like
      watching netflix shows like Lucifier, The 100, Stranger things and Baki. I used
      to play soccer, but I grew out of it and now I occasionally workout by myself or
      with friends.</p>
    <h2>Education and Career Plans</h2>
    <div class="homepgpic"> <img src="images/investing.jpg" alt="image of stock chart"></div>
    <p>I transferred from Sacramento City College and now I am a junior at UC Davis. 
      I used to major in Manegerial Economics, but changed it to Computer
      Science. I wanted to major in Manegerial Economics because I was interested in
      investing and real estate for a brief period of time. I don't love programming,
      but I chose the major because I feel like there will always be demand for
      programmer in the job market. My short term goal is to do as many interships as I
      can before I graduate. My long term goal is to get my Bachelors Degree and get a
      good paying job.<br><br> </p>
